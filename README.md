# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Delay Regression Report

This project evaluates the model performance for predicting flight arrival delays (`ArrDelay`) using the [DelayedFlights dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses) and simulates prediction quality analysis using [Evidently AI](https://www.evidentlyai.com/).

## üì¶ Dataset Summary

- **Source**: Bureau of Transportation Statistics (via Kaggle)
- **File**: `DelayedFlights.csv`
- **Target Variable**: `ArrDelay` (renamed to `target`)
- **Features Used**:
  - `DepDelay`: Departure delay
  - `Distance`: Flight distance
  - `AirTime`: Time in the air
- **Prediction Simulation**: Created by adding Gaussian noise (`N(0, 10)`) to the true target.

## üìä Key Findings from Evidently Report

### ‚úÖ Model Performance Overview

| Metric                   | Reference | Current | Interpretation                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mean Error**           | -0.23     | -0.08   | Model slightly under-predicts on average in both datasets. |
| **MAE (Mean Abs Error)** | 8.11      | 8.06    | Consistent performance between past and recent data.       |
| **RMSE**                 | 10.126    | 10.106  | Low variation in prediction error; stable model behavior.  |
| **R¬≤ Score**             | 0.968     | 0.969   | Very high ‚Äî model explains nearly all delay variance.      |
| **Abs Max Error**        | 35.44     | 36.98   | A few outliers exist with large error, but not excessive.  |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Dummy Model Comparison

| Metric         | Dummy Model | Actual Model | Interpretation                                   |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dummy MAE**  | 8.065       | 8.06         | Model performs nearly the same as naive average. |
| **Dummy RMSE** | 10.106      | 10.106       | Same as model ‚Äî suggests low added value.        |

### ‚ùå MAPE Issues (Unreliable)

- **MAPE (Current)**: ~3.7e+17%
- **MAPE (Reference)**: ~3.5e+17%
- These values are **absurdly high** due to division by near-zero actual values.
- **Recommendation**: Avoid MAPE on delay datasets ‚Äî use SMAPE or median absolute error instead.

## üß† Interpretation & Recommendations

- ‚úÖ The simulated regression model shows **very high R¬≤** and **stable performance**, indicating strong predictive potential.
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Minimal change in metrics** between reference and current = **no significant performance drift**.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Model performs **similarly to a dummy predictor**, meaning:
  - Feature engineering may need improvement.
  - Simulated prediction method (random noise) is not modeling actual structure ‚Äî replace with a trained model for real evaluation.
- üßπ **MAPE is unreliable** due to extreme values and should be excluded from future reports.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates how Evidently can monitor the regression performance of an arrival delay prediction model. While the current setup simulates predictions, a production model could integrate this report for **live model health checks**, **drift detection**, and **early warning on prediction quality drops**.
